This repository is for my term project for the course Machine Learning EEN-680 , at IIT Roorkee. 
I have explored Q Learning in Reinforcement Learning to find the optimal policy in Grid Search Problem . Using the knowledge acquired in the class I am going to show Q learning in both deterministic and non deterministic case.


## Requisites to run it locally, outside colab (not recommended)
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter
- PyTorch >= 1.8
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Grid Board Q-Learning
