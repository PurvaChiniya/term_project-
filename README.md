This repository is for my term project for the course Machine Learning EEN- , at IIT Roorkee. 
We have explored backpropogation, logistic regression , neural networks in the class. Using that knowledge I am going to show some light on the drawbacks of training a neural network for different tasks.

We will start with learning over the standard MNIST benchmark, then we will move in the actual continual learning setting with the Permuted MNIST benchmark. Let's have some fun! :-)

## Requisites to run it locally, outside colab (not recommended)
